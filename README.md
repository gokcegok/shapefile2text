# Shapefile Reader(shapefile2text)

A shapefile stores nontopological geometry and attribute information for the spatial features in a data set. 
The geometry for a feature is stored as a shape comprising a set of vector coordinates. 

This program reads three partsof a shapefile(.shp, .shx, .dbf) from start to end byte-by-byte, and prints all
information to a .txt file.

I also shared with you some output examples.
